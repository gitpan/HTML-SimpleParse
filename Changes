    - The parse_args routine will now allow whitespace between an attribute
      and its value (on both sides of the equal sign).  I believe this
      is compliant with the SGML spec at
      http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/SGML/sgml-lex/sgml.l .  Thanks to
      jo@homepage-design.net (Joachim Seibert) for the spot.

    - Fixed a bug in the parse_args routine that should properly handle
      escaping of parameters like var="a \"value\"" [thanks, Philippe
      Chiasson]

    - Fixed a bug in HTML::SimpleParse->parse_args('a="b=c"').  Thanks
      to Shenghuo ZHU for finding it.

    - added execute() method that lets you do:
      foreach ($p->tree) {
         print $p->execute($_);
      }
      This lets Apache::OutputChain and Apache::SSIChain output their results in
      the correct order.

    - changed the output_* methods so that they return their
      output, instead of printing it.  There's a new method, get_output(),
      which returns a string containing the parsed output.  The
      output() method then prints the result of get_output().
      This lets the module work with Apache::OutputChain.  Thanks to 
      Honza Pazdziora for the patches (which I modified a little).
    
    - fixed the processing of markup declarations (e.g. <!DOCTYPE ...>)
    
    - parse_args method can handle leading whitespace now:
      my %hash=HTML::SimpleParse->parse_args(' A="xx" B');
      used to return an empty hash (thanks to Ben Laurie again).
      
    - parse_args makes sure that it starts matching at the beginning
      of the string you give it, by setting pos() to 0.
    
    I'm also going to update Apache::SSI so that it can use this new version.

    - fixed bug in parse_args method pointed out by Ben Laurie:
       %hash=HTML::SimpleParse->parse_args('A="xx" B');
       did not include B in %hash.
